## On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?
HTML is used to describe the structure of a website. HTML uses elements and tags to define the the basics of how the webpage will be viewed.
## What is the difference between an element and a tag?
An element tells the browser something about the information that sits between the opening and closing tags. A tag informs the browser of the beginning or end of the element contained within.

Attributes are used to provided additional information about an element. By providing a name (which indicates what kind of extra information we are adding), and a value (which provides the actual information for the attribute), we can create more detailed structures for our website.
## Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.
The _head_ element is used to provide information about the page, but does not appear in the maid body of the page on a browser
The _title_ element is used to indicate the title of the webpage you are visiting. In Chrome (or other browsers that allow multiple tabs), this is what appears on each individual tab.
The _body_ element indicates the beginning and end of everything that will appear in the browser window.
## In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?
You can navigate to the site, right-click anywhere on the page and select "View Page Source" from the menu.
